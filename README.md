# BuddyPairingCSP
Toy project with OR-Tools/CSPs

# Motivation
Given a list of questions/preferences from a bunch of people, how do
we ~~shove~~ define inputs such that a CSP or Optimization tool like
OR-Tools can operate over it and generate a reasonable solution
from given inputs

or alternatively
* how do we boil down human relationship formation into a graph (maybe) *
